**Lean Theorem Proving Exercises and Examples**

This repository contains a collection of examples and exercises derived from the e-book "Theorem Proving in Lean 4" available at [https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/). It includes direct copies of some demonstrations and examples from the book, enhanced with additional comments to clarify and expand upon key concepts. Furthermore, I have provided my own solutions to the exercises presented in the book, showcasing practical applications of Lean 4 in theorem proving.

The primary goal of this repository is to offer a hands-on approach to learning Lean 4 theorem proving, supplemented with personal insights and solutions to facilitate understanding and engagement with the material.
